##Getting started
navigate to one of the folders and enter the following command:
```
both folders: npm install
back-end: npm run start:dev
front-end: npm run dev
```

##Setting up the environment from scratch:
```
enter the following:
npm i  @nestjs/cli
npx nest new "project-name"
npx create-next-app@latest  
```
this will create two app folders, you can then delete the node files from the current folder
